We Use Ant-Design to make all interfaces look cleaner and beautiful.

## Consistent Design

We've used a consistent design system throughout the application to ensure familiarity and ease of use. This includes using a consistent color scheme, typography, and spacing, as well as employing reusable components for common elements like buttons and forms.

## Clear Navigation

We've designed a simple and clear navigation system that makes it easy for users to move between different sections of the application. The main navigation menu is always accessible and provides clear labels for each section, along with intuitive icons.

## Responsive Layout

We've ensured that our application is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes and devices. This ensures a seamless user experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## User Feedback and Error Handling

Our application provides clear and timely feedback to users in the form of success messages, error messages, and progress indicators. This helps users understand the state of the system and any actions they need to take.
